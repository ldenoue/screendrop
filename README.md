# ScreenDrop

ScreenDrop is a browser extension to quickly record your screen and voice.
Once you have recorded your video, ScreenDrop can automatically drop it into Slack, Gmail, Twitter, Google Docs or other web apps that accept a video being dragged and dropped.

It works both for Chrome and Firefox.

Please suggest other web app ScreenDrop should support, perhaps Microsoft Teams?
