# Yawas

Yawas (Yet Another Web Annotation System) is a browser extension to highlight web pages and PDF documents.
It works both for Chrome and Firefox.

As of August 2021, your annotations are stored in the built-in Chrome (or Firebox) Bookmarks.
Since the chrome.bookmarks API only allows storing a URL and a title fields, Yawas stores your highlights inside the title field.
To keep things clean, a new Yawas folder is created at the root of your Chrome Bookmarks.

There is also a new option allowing you to import your online Google Bookmarks into Chrome Bookmarks: click on the Yawas icon in your toolbar to show that option.

You can clone this repository and install the extension locally.

You can also download it directly for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yawas-web-and-pdf-highlig/kjlghdmljfgngjdpeaiogebkiilpiimk?hl=en) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yawas-web-and-pdf-highlighter/)
