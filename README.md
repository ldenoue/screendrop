# ScreenDrop

ScreenDrop is a browser extension to quickly record your screen and voice.
Once you have recorded your video, ScreenDrop can automatically drop it into Slack.
Working to add other destinations. (Gmail, Twitter, Google Docs, others?)

Tested on Chrome. Thanks for letting me know if it works in other browsers.

# Install on Chrome

Download from the Chrome Extension store https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screendrop/odongoegohecelohldpmpbihahfgolpo?hl=en

Or load the unpacked extension from GitHub:
- `git clone https://github.com/ldenoue/screendrop.git` and then open Chrome `Manage Extensions` and click `Load Unpacked` to pick the folder where you cloned this repo.
