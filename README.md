# ScreenDrop

ScreenDrop is a browser extension to quickly record your screen and voice.
Once you have recorded your video, ScreenDrop can automatically drop it into Slack.
Working to add other destinations. (Gmail, Twitter, Google Docs, others?)

Tested on Chrome. Thanks for letting me know if it works in other browsers.

# Install on Chrome
